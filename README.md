# üî¨ ADR Signal Detection System
## Automated Pharmacovigilance Using Statistical Analysis

**Project by:** Harshal Gosavi  
**Date:** October 2025 
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

## üìã PROJECT OVERVIEW

### Objective
Developed an automated Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) signal detection system that analyzes large-scale pharmaceutical safety data to identify potential drug safety concerns using statistical disproportionality analysis.

### Problem Statement
Traditional pharmacovigilance relies on manual review of adverse event reports. With thousands of drugs and millions of side effect reports, it's impossible for humans to detect patterns efficiently. This project demonstrates how data science can automate signal detection and flag high-risk drug-effect combinations for further investigation.

## üéØ KEY ACHIEVEMENTS

### Data Scale
- **Total Reports Analyzed:** 1,000,000+ individual drug-side effect reports
- **Unique Drugs:** 10,000+ medicines in the dataset
- **Side Effects Tracked:** 500+ distinct adverse reactions
- **Signals Detected:** 6,686 potential safety signals identified

### Top Findings

**Most Reported Side Effects (Top 5):**
1. Nausea - 157,428 reports
2. Diarrhea - 140,295 reports
3. Vomiting - 100,331 reports
4. Headache - 99,015 reports
5. Dizziness - 72,637 reports

**Highest Risk Signals Detected:**
- Several drug-effect pairs showed PRR values exceeding 2,000x
- This means certain side effects were reported over 2,000 times more frequently for specific drugs compared to all other drugs
- These represent critical safety signals requiring immediate attention

**Signal Categories:**
- Strong Signals (PRR > 100): 215 drug-effect pairs
- Moderate Signals (PRR 10-100): 1,847 pairs
- Weak Signals (PRR 2-10): 4,624 pairs

## üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL METHODOLOGY

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Input:** Raw CSV file with multiple side effect columns per drug
- **Transformation:** Converted from wide format (multiple sideEffect columns) to long format (one row per drug-effect pair)
- **Cleaning:** Standardized text data (lowercase, whitespace removal), removed null values
- **Result:** Clean dataset with 1M+ drug-side effect observations

### 2. Statistical Analysis - Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR)

**PRR Formula:**
```
PRR = (a / (a+c)) / (b / (b+d))

Where:
a = Count of (Drug X, Side Effect Y)
b = Count of (All Other Drugs, Side Effect Y)
c = Count of (Drug X, All Other Side Effects)
d = Count of (All Other Drugs, All Other Side Effects)
```

**Signal Threshold:** PRR > 2 with at least 3 reports

**Why PRR?**
PRR is a validated pharmacovigilance metric used by regulatory agencies like the FDA and EMA. It measures disproportionality - if a side effect is reported significantly more often for one drug compared to others, it suggests a causal relationship.

### 3. Signal Detection Logic
```python
Signal Criteria:
- PRR > 2 (Side effect reported 2x more frequently)
- Count ‚â• 3 (Not just random chance)
- Statistical significance considered through frequency
```
